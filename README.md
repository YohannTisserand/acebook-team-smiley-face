# Bookface

A full-stack web app inspired by the functionality of Facebook. The web app allows the user to sign up, add friends, and make a post, message and more.

The features built in this project are based on [user stories.](./resources/user_stories.md)

Design, layout, functionality, and features were inspired by Facebook.


## 🏁 Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone the repo then install the required gems:

```sh
bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```sh
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

Run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly, but first seed the test database with our test data.

```sh
rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=test
rspec
```

If the test suite passes, run the app in a local server:

```sh
rails server
```
